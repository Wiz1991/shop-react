# Shopping Cart

## Introduction

This project is built as an [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/shopping-chart) for [TheOdinProject's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) React curriculum.

You can view the live page [HERE](https://clumsynite.github.io/react-shopping-cart/)

This is a template eCommerce website focusing on routes. The web app was made so that no refreshes are needed to open any page thanks to react-router-dom.

It includes the following routes:

| Name         | Route       |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| **Home**     | _/_         |
| **Products** | _/products_ |
| **Cart**     | _/cart_     |
